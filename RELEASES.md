# BourneWise release provenance

This file records the source lineage of production releases. Cloudflare builds
pull-request branches as previews and deploys `main` to the public site. The
`production` branch is an append-only verified mirror and rollback anchor:
release merges keep their parents, and it must never be squashed, rebased, or
force-pushed.

## 20260815e — Lianqian production baseline

- Production target: `main` via pull request
- Verified mirror: `production`
- Integration branch: `codex-creem-integration`
- Visual lineage:
  - `aa49ba2` — replace Baoxianghua with the section-aware Lianqian texture system
  - `d1eac52` — remove Baoxianghua runtime hooks and public composition entry point
- Claude functional lineage:
  - `f246ce8` — preserve partial readings after a cut stream
  - `3401472` — send intent and follow-up prompts as user turns
  - `f761def` — route follow-ups by method
  - `2bc99e8` — derive rate-card figures from the assembled prompt
- Verification:
  - primary pages load Lianqian assets and expose zero Baoxianghua runtime rules
  - JavaScript syntax checks pass
  - billing, copy, request, stream recovery, prompt secrecy, prompt coverage,
    session, and rate-card contracts pass

The integration branch is previewed before merge. Once its pull request lands
in `main`, Cloudflare promotes the same traceable commit graph to the public
site; `production` retains the verified release point for audit and rollback.

## 20260815j — Compact documents and stable casting entry

- Production target: `main` via pull request after local visual approval
- Integration branch: `codex-creem-integration`
- Visual changes:
  - about, guide, terms, privacy, and refunds now use one compact editorial
    document system instead of full-screen poster panels
  - app chrome follows a deeper readable accent from the active palette while
    excluding saturated green and purple candidates
  - ridge travel stays inside the safe SVG repeat area, removing the large
    closing-edge slab that could enter from the right
- Functional changes:
  - the HTML build stamp matches `version.json`, so the freshness guard no
    longer rejects every cast as an outdated page
  - an automated build/version contract prevents this failure from recurring
- Verification:
  - build/version, billing, palette, texture, and copy contracts pass
  - app, guide, about, and legal layouts were checked in the local browser

## 20260815i — Square Lianqian grid and restored palette field

- Production target: `main` via pull request #56
- Verified mirror: `production` after public deployment
- Integration branch: `codex-creem-integration`
- Visual lineage:
  - `73e5af5` — compact, seamless Lianqian texture assets
  - `14204b5` — restore all ten animated ridge colours plus sky and water
  - current release — render every connected-coin texture on a square grid
- Functional lineage: unchanged from the `20260815e` baseline
- Verification:
  - 180 palette groups retain ten ridge colours plus sky and water
  - Lianqian repeats compute to equal horizontal and vertical CSS dimensions
  - billing, palette, texture, and copy contracts pass
  - local About and app routes render without console errors or horizontal overflow
